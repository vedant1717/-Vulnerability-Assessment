# Vulnerability Assessment Project

## Overview

This project involves the installation, configuration, and utilization of the Nessus vulnerability scanner on macOS to perform comprehensive vulnerability assessments. The project aims to identify and analyze system vulnerabilities and develop effective remediation strategies.

## Features

- **Nessus Installation and Configuration**: Installed and configured the Nessus vulnerability scanner on macOS.
- **Comprehensive Vulnerability Scans**: Conducted detailed vulnerability scans using Nessus, including credentialed scans to uncover more in-depth vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability Identification and Analysis**: Identified and analyzed system vulnerabilities, including testing with deliberately installed vulnerable software.
- **Remediation Strategies**: Developed and implemented effective remediation strategies to address and mitigate identified vulnerabilities.

## Identified Vulnerabilities

Some of the identified vulnerabilities included outdated versions of the following software:
- Google Chrome
- VLC Media Player
- Mozilla Firefox
- Node.js
- Zoom
- Ruby

## Installation
